        <h2>Shinobi Career</h2>
        <p>When we say that Sasuke worships Itachi, we shouldn't miss the fact that he's at least a little bit jealous of him. Being compared to him all the time, and obviously not measuring - and being ingored by his father (whose approval Sasuke desperately seeks), because of that - very much grates on Sasuke and makes him too bitter for an eight year old boy.

When Itachi kills the clan and leaves Sasuke behind, he's devastated. The person whom he loved above all else took everything away from him. Labelling himself an "avenger", Sasuke now lives for killing his brother.</p>
